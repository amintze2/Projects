Calendar Application

Description: 
This is a web-based calendar application where the user can create, manage, and store events. 
The application is designed with a simple interface where the user can easily view upcoming events,
with a monthly and weekly view. The goal of this project was to create a way for those with busy 
schedule, like college students, to keep track of all upcoming tasks and functions.

Features: 
New Events: Users can add new events to a given day with the time, location, and any notes.
Delete Events: With a simple click, the user can remove an event from the day.
Monthly and Daily View: Users can change the view from a monthly overview to viewing 
exculsivly events in a given week.
Month and Week Toggle: Users can click on arrow keys on the top right of the screen to move forward 
or backwards one month or week, depending on what the view is set to.
Today Button: By clicking on the "Today" button, users will be taken back to the month/week that the
current day is on. 
Persistent Storage: Because all events are stored in local storage, the user can refresh or exisit 
the site and the events that had been stored will be saved.

Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Storage: Local Storage (browser-based)

Installation:
Download or Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/amintze2/Projects.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd Projects/CalendarApp
Open the index.html file in your browser

Code Structure
/css: Contains the stylesheets for the application.
/js: Contains the JavaScript files that handle the calendar logic and event management.
/index.html: The main HTML file that structures the calendar layout.

Challenged Faced: 
The major challenge in this project involved thinking about the how to structure the events class 
and how to assign each event into storage most efficently, ensuring that multiple events could be stored 
on a given day.
What I learned:
Improved my proficiency in vanilla JavaScript for handling DOM manipulation and event-driven programming.
Gained experience in designing responsive layouts with CSS.
Learned how to effectively use browser local storage for data persistence.
Future Improvements:
Event Editing: Implement functionality to click on events to change them. 
User Authentication: Add user login and authentication to personalize event management.
Recurring Events: Implement functionality to support recurring events.
Acknowledgments:
